# My-CSharp-Code

This is just a repository for projects I'll eventually create in order to put into practive programming languages theories I have been learning throughout my journey. My FIRST projects will NOT be intended to become MAJOR projects, but to APPLY some concepts INSTEAD. I WILL eventually commit a big project where I'll be able to put most of things I have learned into practice in just one, more real-life/commercial application hopefully.

Coding in C# gives a lot of pleasure and I hope to eventually grasp most of its particularities as well as all of its most important sytaxes and semantics.

I hope to update this file as I advance in my journey.

Keep in mind I have been learning other languages parallelly to this one.
